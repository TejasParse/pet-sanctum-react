Project Title- Pet Sanctum
Pet Sanctum is a pet adoption website.

This is a full-stack website made using React that helps users adopt pet animals from the website and at the same time allows users to upload their pet information if they wish to abandon their pet and also apply for the rescue of stray animals.

To install all the node modules, type the following command-
npm install

If on running the react application, it asks to run the application on a port other than 3000, allow it to do so by typing yes.
